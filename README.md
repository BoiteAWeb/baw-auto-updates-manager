Auto Updates Manager
====================

Auto Updates Manager is a WordPress plugin designed to control the new (since 3.7) auto updates features.

WordPress doen't want that people can easily modify this settings, but depending on our need or client needs, sometimes we want to take full control of that.

With Auto Updates Manager, you will go farther than any existing plugin because you can select one per one, each plugin or theme to be automatically updated.

Just check some boxes, that's all.

Bonus : you can force an autoupdate with 1 single click.
